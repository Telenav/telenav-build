## Source Control &nbsp; <img src="https://telenav.github.io/telenav-assets/images/icons/branch-32.png" srcset="https://telenav.github.io/telenav-assets/images/icons/branch-32-2x.png 2x"/>

Telenav open source projects are published on [Github](https://www.github.com/) and use Git for source control. 

### Git Flow

All Telenav open source repositories adhere to the standard [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching model.
This model specifies the following branch naming convention:

| Branch      | Purpose               |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| `master`    | Latest stable release |
| `develop`   | Development build     |
| `feature/*` | Feature branches      |
| `hotfix/*`  | Hot fix branches      |

### Scripts

After following the [initial setup instructions](initial-setup-instructions.md), the scripts below will be available.

> All Telenav scripts are named so that you can easily discover them with command-line completion.  
> To see what scripts are available, type `telenav-` and hit `TAB`.

| Script                                               | Purpose                                                   |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| *telenav-git-checkout.sh* `scope`**?** `branch-name` | Checks out the given branch for the scoped repositories   |
| *telenav-git-commit.sh* `scope`**?** `message`       | Commits to the scoped repositories with the given message |
| *telenav-git-hard-reset.sh*                          | Resets the current repository, losing all changes         |
| *telenav-git-is-dirty.sh* `scope`**?**               | Shows which scoped repositories are dirty                 |
| *telenav-git-pull.sh* `scope`**?**                   | Pulls from all scoped repositories                        |
| *telenav-git-status.sh*                              | Shows the status of all repositories in the workspace     |

Where `scope` is one of:
 
 - `all` - All repositories in the TELENAV_WORKSPACE
 - `this` - The project in the current folder
 - `[family-name]` - A family of repositories, such as `kivakit`, `mesakit` or `lexakai`
